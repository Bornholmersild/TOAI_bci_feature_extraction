# TOAI_bci_feature_extraction

This repository contains the source code, figures, datasets, and results associated with my Master's education in Robotics. The core implementation is based on the course material, with additional methods I developed for the Tools of Artificial Intelligence (2025) exam.

All code is designed to reproduce the results shown in the report.

Due to the large size of the EEG dataset, it is not hosted on GitHub. 
If you wish to access the data, please contact me directly or reach out to the course instructors for access through the education platform.

Required dependencies can be installed using the requirements.txt file.
